# CV

Designer and ex-architect (buildings) bridging the gap between physical and digital environments.

# Edbert Cheng

I am a front-end developer and digital designer passionate about creating human-centered experiences, spanning both physical and digital realms. 

I started my coding journey in the summer of 2020, during the height of the pandemic, when I began to study front-end development full-time and enrolled in freeCodeCamp. I am always finding new ways to conceptualize problems and ask better questions. You can find my creative design work on my personal website, www.edbertcheng.com.
